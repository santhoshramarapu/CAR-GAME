// (11) Firstly, we have four movements for our car i.e. (the player's car) like right, left, up and down



//  The on() is an inbuilt method in jQuery which is used to attach one or more event handlers for
//      the selected elements and child elements in the DOM tree.

// The keydown event occurs when a keyboard key is pressed down.
//  The keydown() method triggers the keydown event, or attaches a function to run when a keydown event occurs.

// (12) We say document dot on keyword function, and let's save it to a variable 'e'
    $(document).on('keydown', function(e) {
// (13) So, on keydown, we have to check whether the game_over is still false
        if (game_over === false) {

          // The event.keyCode property returns the Unicode character code of the key that triggered the onkeypress event,
          //  or the Unicode key code of the key that triggered the onkeydown or onkeyup event.

// (14)  That is, if the game is not over, We'll save the key to a variable called key which is a key pressed
//           which we're going to say as keyCode.
// (15) We'll get the key pressed and we're saving it to a variable called key.
            var key = e.keyCode;
// (16) Now, let's write the code for moving the car to the left using the left arrow key.
//       The key code is 37 for left arrow key on keyboard of a computer.
//         We'll check still the move left is false.

            if (key === 37 && move_left === false) {

          // The requestAnimationFrame() is one of the methods present in JavaScript to powerfully incorporate
          //   amazing and simple animations within our project.

// (17) If it is false, we will update move left with a function which is our request animation frame.
//        We'll use this a lot as this gives a smooth animation across all of the devices out there which the other functions
//            can't provide ( like the setTimeout() or setInterval() functions)
// request animation frame of function, in our case, it is 'left' which we have'nt defined yet. So, let's define it first
                move_left = requestAnimationFrame(left);
// (33) Similarly, now let's write the code for the right arrow key. The right arrow key keyCode is 39 and the function
//       name is move_right
            } else if (key === 39 && move_right === false) {

//          have added that condition in the left function below.
// (31) Just add && parse int of car dot css left is greater than zero and that will resolve the our issue.
// (32) Now, after these additional conditions being added to the left function, save it and reload the web page, press the left

// (43) Now taht we are done with the left and right arrow keys, let us proceed further in our discussion and code for
//       up and down arrow keys.
// (37) If it is false then car dot css of left. If we want to move the car to the right, we are going to increase the left
//        So, this is going to be plus five
            car.css('left', parseInt(car.css('left')) + 5);

// (65) For this purpose, we are going to use another request animation frame and we'll save that id animation to a variable we declared
